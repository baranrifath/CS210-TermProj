# CS210 YTMusic Project
The purpose of this study is to examine the connection between my YouTube Music usage and mental health by analyzing listening habits, song preferences, and their possible effects on state of mind during the day. I intend to understand the relationships between emotions (e.g., anxiety, joy, sorrow) and music consumption patterns (such as frequency, length, genre) using YouTube metadata.

Tools Planned to Use for Data Collection: YouTube API, Python (BeautifulSoup), Google Takeout
